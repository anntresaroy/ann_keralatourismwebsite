	The royal palace of the Thekkumkur ruler was protected by a fort called Thaliyilkotta. It is believed that the name Kottayam is derived from a combination of the Malayalam words kotta which means fort (Thaliyilkotta) and akam which means inside. The combined form, Kottaykkakam (കോട്ടയ്ക്കകം), can be translated as "inside the fort"
